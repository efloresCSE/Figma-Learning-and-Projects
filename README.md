## About

Figma is a cloud-based design tool that allows for real-time collaboration and prototyping. It's widely used in UI/UX design for web and mobile applications. This repository is my space to practice and showcase various aspects of Figma, from wireframing and prototyping to creating high-fidelity designs.

My goals for this repository are:
- To document my progress in learning Figma.
- To build and share design projects that showcase UI/UX principles.
- To experiment with different design approaches and techniques.
